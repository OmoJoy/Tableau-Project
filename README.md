# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The project's objective is to generate insights through a range of visualizations and dashboards, leveraging data on Real Estate Prices and Incomes across diverse districts in Canada. These insights aim to enhance the understanding of real estate price fluctuations across Canadian districts over time and facilitate comparisons with changes in income levels.

## Process
I began the project by thoroughly reviewing the instructions and familiarizing myself with the available options. After this, I opted for Option 1.

Next, I acquired the necessary datasets, downloading them for use. I uploaded all these datasets, encompassing both CSV and JSON file types, into Tableau.

Following this, I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain a deep understanding of the data, its types, and to identify any missing values or necessary data preparations for visualization.

To align my comprehension of the dataset with the project's objectives, I revisited the project's goals.

Then, I performed data manipulations and created calculated fields to obtain the data required for visualization, ensuring that specific insights could be derived.

Finally, I tackled each project objective individually, selecting the most suitable visualizations and crafting insights to aid business leaders and stakeholders in making informed decisions.



## Results
I selected Option 1 and utilized all six available datasets for the project. To provide valuable insights for decision-makers, I employed various chart types in my visualizations, including Line Charts, Tree Maps, Area Charts, Bar Charts, and even incorporated Trend Analysis in some graphs.

In summary, the key conclusions drawn from the project are as follows:

Over the past four decades, there has been a consistent increase in real estate prices for both homes and offices, with the most significant surge occurring between 1983 and 1984.

Greater Vancouver, Lower Mainland, and Oakville Milton are the Canadian districts with the highest real estate prices, and these prices have remained relatively stable across these regions.

Earnings in Canada have displayed consistent year-on-year growth.

In 2001, Canadians allocated over 150% of their incomes to home expenses, but this percentage dropped significantly to slightly over 50% in 2014.

Despite examining key economic events, no direct correlation was found between these events and changes in Canadian incomes or real estate prices. However, there is a slight relationship with the cost of house construction materials, which experienced a dip during these significant years.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and House Price Index (HPI) have grown at the same rate over the years, indicating a lack of substantial difference between them.

## Challenges 
During the project, I encountered several challenges:

Importing JSON files into Tableau proved difficult initially, resulting in inaccurate tables. To address this issue, I utilized Python and pandas to convert the JSON data into a dataframe, which was subsequently exported as a CSV file.

Manipulating data within Tableau was another challenge I faced. However, I am confident that with more practice and experience with the application, I will improve my skills in this area.

I also encountered limitations when selecting specific visualizations, although I'm uncertain if these limitations were due to the version of the application I was using.

## Future Goals
Given more time, I would have chosen Option 2 and delved into one of the alternative questions. I believe this would have presented a greater challenge, offering an excellent opportunity to acquire new skills and further hone my expertise.
